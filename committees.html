                                                        Political power struggles aside, safeguarding the lives of the

                                                        A compelling element of the committee is the fact that it is to
                                                        be presided by the Minister of External Affairs and his staff,
                                                        who will ensure that the cabinet effectively averts forthcoming
                                                        diplomatic crisis situations. The committee will also observe
                                                        key leaders, including the Prime Minister, and other relevant
                                                        parliamentary committee representatives.

                                                    <p>1)In July 2018, the government in Haiti announced the withdrawal
                                                        of subsidies on fuel, leading to 50 per cent price hikes.
                                                        Agitated masses rose up in protest, leading to rampant thievery.
                                                        Danger to foreign tourists and volunteers stranded in the
                                                        country has necessitated the intervention of the Security
                                                        Council, which must take action to restore normalcy in the
                                                        region. Creative solutions, tactful negotiation, concrete action
                                                        - delegates must use every means at their disposal to ensure
                                                        timely and peaceful resolution of the crisis.

                                                        2)Mali is in the grip of an unprecedented crisis, as it faces
                                                        dual challenges of Islamist extremism as well as insurgency
                                                        forces. Five major terrorist groups have taken control of
                                                        central Mali, imposing strict Sharia law, and spreading jihad.
                                                        Military-style executions, mutilation of bodies in the name of
                                                        Islamic law, kidnapping of Western aid workers and tourists, is
                                                        rampant. In the absence of a strong government and a unified
                                                        military, it falls to the Security Council to restore peace in

                                                            Media is the persistent watchdog, the impartial judge,
                                                            the meticulous custodian that records humanity's
                                                            greatest achievements and failures. It has the power to
                                                            topple governments, mould public opinion, and unmask
                                                            even the most surreptitious conspiracy. A testament to
                                                            the power of the press - in 2001, investigative magazine
                                                            Tehelka conducted the infamous 'Operation West End', a
                                                            sting operation that successfully unveiled the rampant
                                                            corruption in the Defense Ministry. Numerous senior
                                                            officials were caught accepting bribes on tape, which
                                                            sparked nationwide outrage and resulted in the
                                                            resignation of the then Defense Minister, George

                                                            Despite the merits of the press, we live in an era where
                                                            news has been reduced to sensational headlines and
                                                            baseless controversies. As such, it is imperative for
                                                            journalists to be impartial, objective, and above all,
                                                            reliable. Media outlets are flooded with citizen
                                                            reporters masquerading as journalists, and circulating
                                                            unverified information devoid of context. Blatant lies,
                                                            doctored clips, and photoshopped images are being used
                                                            to further political propaganda, and innocent civilians
                                                            get caught in the crossfire.
